max for live &amp; max 6.1 routing &amp; patch management system for grids (+arcs?)


system for handling multiple serialosc capable devices, and applications.

2 aspects:

-- a centralised monome distributor for connecting devices & acting as hub
-- a standardised template for m4l apps that have monome device interaction


host (for satellites)

- this should have a really obvious name like host, home, main so it's obvious that it is required
- handles the connection with serialosc
- saves device setup & auto-connects on patch load
- this patch should handle the interface management: current idea is to hold a single button (top-right?) as a shift, then press a key corresponding to the patch you want to control.

?? should there be an option (selectable) to use auto-focus (ala stretta suite) where you can simply select the track and the first patch on that channel takes control of the interface???



available patches
-- include an .als project demonstrating capabilities

ableton live-api control

midi generators

--pitch mapping w/ complex arpeggiators (polygome / tintinnabulome etc)
--conway's game of life
--flin

audio instruments
--grainstorm
--electric dharma wheels

audio samplers
--mlrv (multi-channel version) what's the most solid 'live clip chopper'? how is the latency these days through liveapi?
--tml (is stretta's 'lpr' the same thing but better?)

cc generators
